## Terraform Module - Karpenter | ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ 
Karpenter is an open-source, flexible, high-performance Kubernetes cluster autoscaler built with AWS. Here I will be installing Karpenter and deploying Karpenter Provisioners to an EKS cluster using Terraform



## Key Features of Karpenter
```
âœ… Watching for pods that the Kubernetes scheduler has marked as waiting for schedule
âœ… Evaluating scheduling constraints (resource requests, node selectors, affinities, tolerations, and topology spread constraints)
âœ… Provisioning nodes that meet the requirements of the pods
âœ… Removing the nodes when the nodes are no longer needed
```


## Complements :
```
âœ… Terraform
âœ… Crossplane
```

## Karpenter Example :
```
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1alpha5
kind: Provisioner
metadata:
name: default
spec:
#Requirements that constrain the parameters of provisioned nodes. 
#Operators { In, NotIn } are supported to enable including or excluding values
  requirements:
    - key: "node.kubernetes.io/instance-type" #If not included, all instance types are considered
      operator: In
      values: ["m5.large", "m5.2xlarge"]
    - key: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone" #If not included, all zones are considered
      operator: In
      values: ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
    - key: "kubernetes.io/arch" #If not included, all architectures are considered
	  operator: In
      values: ["arm64", "amd64"]
    - key: " karpenter.sh/capacity-type" #If not included, the webhook for the AWS cloud provider will default to on-demand
      operator: In
      values: ["spot", "on-demand"]
  provider:
    instanceProfile: KarpenterNodeInstanceProfile-eks-karpenter-demo
