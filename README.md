## Terraform Module - Karpenter | ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ 
Karpenter is an open-source, flexible, high-performance Kubernetes cluster autoscaler built with AWS. Here I will be installing Karpenter and deploying Karpenter Provisioners to an EKS cluster using Terraform



## Key Features of Karpenter
```
âœ… Watching for pods that the Kubernetes scheduler has marked as waiting for schedule
âœ… Evaluating scheduling constraints (resource requests, node selectors, affinities, tolerations, and topology spread constraints)
âœ… Provisioning nodes that meet the requirements of the pods
âœ… Removing the nodes when the nodes are no longer needed
```


## Complements :
```
âœ… Terraform
âœ… Crossplane
```
